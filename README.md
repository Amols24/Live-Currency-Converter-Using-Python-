Notes

    Web Scraping Limitations: The script uses web scraping to fetch exchange rates from Google search results. Changes in Google's HTML structure may affect the script's ability to retrieve data. Ensure that you comply with Google's terms of service when scraping their content.
    Currency Support: The script supports a predefined list of currencies. You can modify the currencies list in the script to add or remove currencies.

Troubleshooting

    No Exchange Rate Found: If the script cannot find the exchange rate, verify that the HTML structure of the Google search results page has not changed. Update the class names in the rate_parser function if necessary.
    Network Issues: Ensure you have a stable internet connection and that there are no issues accessing Google's search results page.
